1. Only cards that character used in anime/manga/scripted duel.
2. Multiples of cards only if character used multiples
3. Video games and V-Jump recipes of characters dont count.
4. If the character has less than 40 cards ever revealed, then it is ok
to have a <40 card deck.

Many anime cards have yet to be added to the game so
these decks may become stronger in future.
